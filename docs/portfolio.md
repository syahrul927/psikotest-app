# Psychological Testing Platform
_Transformed paper-based psychological assessments into digital experiences used by psychologists worldwide._

---

## 🔍 Overview
Traditional psychological assessments required psychologists to manually distribute folders, manually grade over 300 responses, and calculate complex scoring formulas by hand. This process took 6-8 hours per assessment, creating massive bottlenecks. I built a digital platform that now handles the entire workflow - from test distribution to instant scoring and professional analysis - reducing assessment turnaround from days to minutes while supporting psychologists, HR professionals, and educators globally.
